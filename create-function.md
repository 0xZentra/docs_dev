# Create Function

Due to the scarce of the global state, we try to be very careful when creating new function. Adding functions are to add new features to current blockchain ecosystem.

However, on the playground everyone is free to create and test the function and make arbitrary change to the global state.



We see the function creating as the open discuss and propose process. The innovation is blockchain world is either about have a new idea and form the consensus.

In Zentra, the way to deploy a function is to proposal a ZIP by description the problem to solve. To simplify the process, there will be a brief description about why, what and how.

Thanks to the readability of python, it is recommend to show the code directly in the proposal. We will provide the example of ZIPs in very soon.

# Design Philosophy

Zentra with Minus Theory makes the first upgradable ecosystem. Within Zentra, we have long term mission to build both DeFi and future dapps for AI and IoT data.

We could reuse the existing EVM approch to build smart contract. However, we learn the experience from both Ethereum and Solana, and decide to step further.

People talk about the "code is law" and make deployed smart contract inmutable. However, because of it is the "law", they should be reviewed instead of permissionless deployment. In Bitcoin, people can use the network permissionlessly with BTC as transaction fee. But in Ethereum, the permissionless smart contract deployment caused the " dark forest on-chain" and a huge waste of global state space. We believe the blockchain should have basic audited code process like a simplified EIP, to give people basic trust of the code behind a token, instead of checking the ERC20 code everytime.

In Zentra, the global state space is designed to be a scalcity resource. It aims to prevent the state explorsion and ensure everyone could run the indexer for the decentrailzation. This enourages developers to reuse the code like people did in Solana program. It would be good for the non-developers create dapp with existing tested code, which lowering the threshold for blockchain use.

These design philosophies suggest that people design high-quality reusable code on Zentra, rather than deploying a large amount of disposable code in many existing Ethereum smart contract dapps.

# Design Philosophy

Zentra with Minus Theory makes the first upgradable blockchain ecosystem. Within Zentra, we have long term mission to build both DeFi and future Dapps. Users and developers could have a stable and sustainable blockchain environment towards higher TPS, cheaper cost and more decentralization.

We could reuse the existing EVM concepts to build smart contract. However, we learn the experience from both Ethereum and Solana, and decide to step further.

People talk about the "code is law" and make deployed smart contract immutable. However, because of it is the "law", they should be reviewed instead of permissionless deployment. In Bitcoin, people can use the network in permissionless with BTC as transaction fee. But in Ethereum, the permissionless smart contract deployment caused the "dark forest on-chain" and a huge waste of global state space. We believe the blockchain should have basic audited code process like a simplified EIP, to give people basic trust of the code behind a token, instead of checking the ERC20 code every time.

In Zentra, the global state space is designed to be a scarcity resource. It aims to prevent the state explosion and ensure everyone could run the indexer for the decentralization. This encourages developers to reuse the code like people did in Solana program. It would be good for the non-developers create dapp with existing tested code, which lowering the threshold for blockchain use.

These design philosophies suggest that people design high-quality reusable code on Zentra, rather than deploying a large amount of disposable code in many existing Ethereum smart contract dapps.

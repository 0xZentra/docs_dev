# Create Trading Pair

Thanks to the Minus Theory, Zentra gives the Virtual Machine the soft limit of 'gas' capacity. The mission impossible previously in EVM now become possible in Python VM.

The first thing we recall is about the orderbook. CEXs are still using orderbook but it is too complex to have the same logic implemented in the existing smart-contract execution environment. To push the boundaries of DEX, Hyperliquid even went so far as to modify the underlying blockchain technology to create a new infrastructure with built-in support for orderbook.

In Zentra, we first time to make the orderbook running within the VM.&#x20;

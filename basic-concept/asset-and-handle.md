# Asset and Handle

In Zentra, `asset` is a core concept.

`asset` is a name, it could be a brand, company, application or token.

`asset` has a unique tick, starting with upper case alphabet, contains upper case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .



An `asset` does not mean to create token.

An `asset` can hold other asset, just imagine a company can hold some USD dollars, or the stock of other companies .



The `asset` is works functions, the `asset` can define which functions can work on itself.

User can choose which functions to include when creating a new `asset`.



In Zentra, we still keep the concept of EOA in ETH. But the smart contract address is replaced the concept of `asset`. It is readable.

To make EOA readable, Zentra provides the concept of `handle`.

A `handle` is controlled by a EOA.&#x20;

Both the EOA address and `handle` can own an `asset`.

`handle` contains lower case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .

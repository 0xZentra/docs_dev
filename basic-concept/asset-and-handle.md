# Asset and Handle

### Asset

In Zentra, **asset** is a core concept.

**Asset** is a name, it could be a brand, company, application or token.

**Asset** has a unique tick, starting with upper case alphabet, contains upper case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .



An **asset** does not mean token created.

An **asset** can hold other asset, just imagine a company can hold some USD dollars, or the stock of other companies .



The **asset** is working with **function**, the **asset** can select which functions can operate.

User can choose which functions to associate when creating a new **asset**.



In Zentra, we still keep the concept of EOA in ETH. But the smart contract address is replaced the concept of **asset**. It is readable.



### Handle

To make EOA readable, Zentra provides the concept of **handle**.

A **handle** is controlled by a EOA.

Both the EOA address and **handle** can own an **asset**.

**Handle** contains lower case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .

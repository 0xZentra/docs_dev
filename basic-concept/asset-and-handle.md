# Asset and Handle

In Zentra, asset is a core concept.

Asset is a name, it could be a brand, company, application or token.

Asset has a unique tick, starting with upper case alphabet, contains upper case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .



An asset does not mean to create token.

An asset can hold other asset, just imagine a company can hold some USD dollars, or the stock of other companies .



The asset is controlled by functions.

User can choose which functions to include when creating a new asset.



In Zentra, we still keep the concept of EOA in ETH. But the smart contract address is replaced the concept of asset. It is readable.

To make EOA readable, Zentra provides the concept of handle.

A handle is controlled by a EOA.&#x20;

Both the EOA address and handle can own the assets.

Handle contains lower case alphabets and digits, and the underscore \_ .

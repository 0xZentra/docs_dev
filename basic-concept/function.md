# Function

Ethereum and its compatible chains allow developers to deploy smart contract in a permissionless way with gas fee paid. The atomic unit is a smart contract.

Solana try the best to reuse the token program to avoid too much duplicated/similar ERC20 smart contract code being deployed too many times to the global state.

In Zentra, the atomic unit of on chain code is a `function`.

# Zentra Improvement Proposals

ZIP stands for Zentra Improvement Proposals.

Zentra learns experience from existing projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Nervos CKB and Counterparty. Compare to Bitcoin, Ethereum allows developers to deploy smart-contracts in permissionless, it also leads to insecurity modification to ERC20 token code. Solana fixed such issues by introducing the Solana Program Library Tokens. Bitcoin only allows users to use rather than arbitrarily add and modify the features of the blockchain. In Zentra, we are looking for a balance between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Ethereum's EIPs bring a huge impact to the blockchain features, but not every EIP can form such a consensus in the community like ERC20 or 721.

The proposal could be done in a more simplify and efficiency way. It would be good for anyone with some technical background to review and verify. It could be a necessary but minimal process to prevent arbitrary or even malicious code being deployed into the scarce global state, which would waste the resource of indexers and make navigate impact to the decentralization.

In Zentra, we combine the function deployment with ZIP process to form consensus before new dapps or features are official launched on Zentra. It would be helpful for the developers to attract more audience during the idea to engineering stage. It is good for users to stay in a safe environment and reducing the risk of getting hacked.
